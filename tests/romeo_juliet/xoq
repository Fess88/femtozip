    Thou wilt be taken.- Stay awhile!- Stand up; Knock.
    Run to my study.- By-and-by!- God's will,
    What simpleness is this.- I come, I come! Knock.
    Who knocks so hard? Whence come you? What's your will
  Nurse. [within] Let me come in, and you shall know my errand.
    I come from Lady Juliet.
