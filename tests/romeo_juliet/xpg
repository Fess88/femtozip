  Nurse. Here is a ring she bid me give you, sir.
    Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late. Exit.
  Rom. How well my comfort is reviv'd by this!
  Friar. Go hence; good night; and here stands all your state:
    Either be gone before the watch be set,
    Or by the break of day disguis'd from hence.
